✅ Account Management System

A simple console-based bank account management system written in Java.
Demonstrates OOP concepts (classes, encapsulation), collections, and basic banking operations: create account, deposit, withdraw, transfer, and list accounts.

✨ Features

➕ Create new accounts (account number, holder name, initial balance)

💰 Deposit money to an account

➖ Withdraw money from an account (with basic validation)

🔁 Transfer money between accounts

🔍 Show a single account's details

📋 Show all accounts stored in memory

⚠️ Graceful input handling to avoid crashes (InputMismatchException)

🛠 Tech Stack

🧾 Language: Java

⚙️ Runtime: Java 8+ (Java 11+ recommended)

📦 No external libraries — uses standard Java packages

📁 Project Structure

ℹ️ All classes are bundled in one file for simplicity. You can split them into Account.java, AccountManager.java, and AccountManagementSystem.java later.

▶️ How to compile & run

Open terminal/command prompt in project folder and run:

# compile
javac AccountManagementSystem.java

# run
java AccountManagementSystem


If you split classes into separate files:

javac *.java
java AccountManagementSystem


To create and run a JAR (optional):

# compile
javac *.java

# create jar
jar cfe AccountManagementSystem.jar AccountManagementSystem *.class

# run jar
java -jar AccountManagementSystem.jar

🧾 Usage example (sample session)

### 🖼 Example output

✅ Validation & error handling

🛡 Catches InputMismatchException to handle invalid numeric inputs without crashing.

✅ Validates amounts (e.g., deposit > 0, withdraw <= balance).

🗄 Data is stored in memory using a HashMap — all data is lost when the program exits.

🚀 Possible improvements (TODO)

💾 Persist accounts to disk (JSON, CSV, or serialization) so data persists between runs.

🔐 Add account authentication (PIN/password).

📂 Split classes into separate files and add unit tests.

📝 Replace System.out.println with logging.

🖥 Build a GUI (Swing/JavaFX) or a web UI (Spring Boot).

⚖️ Add concurrency control for multi-threaded use.
